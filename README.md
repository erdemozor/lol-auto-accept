# lol-auto-accept
This is a python script for auto-accept League of Legends game requests

## Installation
Go to the release section and **download** the lastest version, uncompress it, and finally run ```auto_accept.exe```. It will prompt a CMD that will tell you what it's doing.

## IMPORTANT
If you have more than one screen, you have to have the LOL Client opened in the one selected as the main one

# Changes from matias4205's script:
The program now keeps looking for games to accept instead of closing down after getting to champ select.
This way, If a match is cancelled after champ select you can rest assured knowing you'll still accept the match.
This does however, use some CPU power while running in the background so the ideal way to use this would be to close the program after getting in a game. Or, you know just leave it on and don't care.
